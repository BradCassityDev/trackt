## Inspiration

We love setting and achieving goals. So many tools and trainings and blogs teach you how to SET good goals but there's never as much focus on how to actually achive the goals you set. We wanted to focus on achiving goals not just setting them. We know that a key component to being successful at the goals you set is having a support system so we created a community for motivated individuals to achieve more. By committing to your goals in a social platform and knowing your friends can see your goals you'll be more committed to achiving them.
